E-commerce Chatbot (Personal Project)

Overview: Developed a conversational chatbot tailored for e-commerce use cases, featuring an interactive interface to assist users with product-related queries.

Architecture:

Implemented using Python, organized within a src directory.

Employed SQLite (db.sqlite) for storing product data, user interactions, or session states.

Functionality:

Signaled by the presence of e-commerce-tool-exercise.md, possibly built as an exercise solution—could involve product search, keyword matching, or basic conversational logic.

Chatbot may process user inputs to retrieve and respond with relevant product data from the SQLite database.

Technologies & Tools:

Python for backend logic.

SQLite as a lightweight relational database.

Jupyter Notebook logic (as indicated by .ipynb language usage) for prototyping or documentation.

Current Status: Initial prototype stage with core functionality established; UX/UI, robust NLP, or deployment pending.
